Velocity TeamCity Reporter
====
TeamCity reporter for Meteor's [Velocity testing framework](https://velocity.meteor.com). This reporter 
will make your test results available to TeamCity.

## Installation
Install this and at least one Velocity-compatible testing framework then add this package:

`meteor add prime8:velocity-teamcity-reporter`

## Usage
Relax. The plugin will detect if it is being run on a TeamCity server and output test results in TeamCity's format.
